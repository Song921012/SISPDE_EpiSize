Codes for the paper.

"src" folder includes the main functions.

If one wants to run the codes.

- First step: installing julia and configuring your julia environment
- Second step: git clone this repo and cd to repe folder
- Third step: start julia and activate this environment, then type "] activate .". This will help you to set up the julia environment. My environment includes packages you may not use, so you can set up your own julia environment following the `Pkg.jl` documentation.
- Run these codes in `paperresults.jl`. One can ignore the other files if you only care about the paper results.
